This plugin will substitutes to [audio] tags a Flash audio player to reproduce the declared audiofile.
Flash component is the opensource Audio Player 2.0 created by Martin Laine (http://www.1pixelout.net).

Where <options> are a space separated list of options where:
		 src=audio_file_URL : is mandatory and it identify the audio file to be player.
	width=123 or width=123%	: is optional and identify the width of the component to be displayed with pixels or %.
	
<label> is a text string which will be written as a label for the audio within the component.
